This is a template to bootstrap your library.

It uses:
  * TypeScript
  * Webpack
  * Jasmine
  * Tslint
  * Eslint (for your testing JS code)
  * TypeDoc.

To start:
  1. Rename `MyLib` in `.eslintrc`, `examples/developing/main.js`, `webpack/common.config.js`
  2. Run `npm install`
  3. Check out `scripts` in `package.json`. For development use `npm start dev`, for building use `npm start build`


### Typedoc

`npm run build` also runs Typedoc. You can run Typedoc manually by running `npm run typedoc`. 


Don't forget to update you `CHANGELOG.md` file.
